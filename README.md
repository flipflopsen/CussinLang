# CussinLang

CussinLang is a programming language implemented in C++ and built with LLVM. It is designed with the purpose of facilitating learning and experimentation in the realm of programming languages. CussinLang incorporates several features such as scopes, method declaration, and strong typing to provide a comprehensive programming experience.

## Features

### Scopes

CussinLang supports the concept of scopes, allowing you to define blocks of code with their own variable bindings. This feature enables better organization and encapsulation of code.

### Method Declaration

With CussinLang, you can declare methods to encapsulate and reuse blocks of code. This promotes code modularity and maintainability by separating logical units of functionality into reusable components.

### Strong Typing

CussinLang enforces strong typing, ensuring that variables are declared with specific data types and preventing implicit type conversions. This feature helps catch errors early and promotes code safety.

## Usage

CussinLang has a straightforward syntax that supports function declarations. Here's an example of the basic format:

```c++
fn main(x: i64, y: i64) -> i64 {
  let z: i64 = x + y;
  return z;
}
```

In this example, the main function takes two parameters of type i64 and returns a value of type i64. It calculates the sum of x and y and assigns the result to z. Finally, the value of z is returned.
Upcoming Features

## Upcoming Features
CussinLang is under active development, and future updates will bring exciting new features to enhance the language further. Some of the upcoming features include:

- Structs: Define custom data structures with associated properties and methods.
- Enums: Create user-defined enumeration types to represent a set of named values.
- Threads: Support concurrent execution through threading capabilities.
- Library: Provide a standard library with common utilities and functions.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to expand the capabilities of CussinLang.
